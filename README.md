# IPv4 TTL Configuration Tool (Windows)

## Overview

This educational script demonstrates how to check and modify the **IPv4 hop limit (TTL)** value on your Windows system. It helps in understanding the impact of TTL on network communication, particularly when using data shared from a phone to a computer.

## Description

This tool is designed to:
- Display the current **IPv4 hop limit (TTL)** for your system.
- Modify the **TTL** to predefined values (128, 65, 64), which can be useful for educational purposes when studying network behavior and packet routing.
  
The script allows users to understand how TTL impacts data transmission and network troubleshooting when using data tethering.

## Features

- Displays the current **IPv4 hop limit** on your system.
- Allows users to select from predefined TTL settings:
  - 128 (Default TTL value)
  - 65 (For simulating specific network conditions)
  - 64 (Another TTL adjustment)
- Educational tool to learn about how TTL values affect network traffic.

## Prerequisites
